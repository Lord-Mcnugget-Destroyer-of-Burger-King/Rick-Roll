    A rookie mistake when Rick Rolling people is to use the offical YouTube <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ>Link</a></h1>
    <h1>This is a Rookie mistake because the link has too "Q's" in it and is easily spotible, I would recomend useing a website like <a href=https://www.latlmes.com>This </a></h1><h1> to try to Rick Roll people</h1>
